# Martinez Studio

This website is made for a  professional photographer who is having his own Photography studio.
5 sections show the spectrum of his proffesion, little gallery, testimonials and social media and contact form.
This web page showing what kind of spectrum of photography he is making and what jobs he made previously.
This website shoud bring interest of customers wanting to hire him or just have a quick sneak peak who he is, and what kind of job studio can make

## UX 

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design.
The navyblue, aqua and white color scheme was chosen to create a modern and sleek feel. 
At the same time Photography made by studio Martinez are very close to nature, in surfer and chilled down style.
But at the same time navy blue and off white should show that he is making always premium service
This is why I chose this kind of color scheme.
 
Website is nice and neaty to navigate. First thing that potential user will see will be a carousel banner with three main photos.
This photos should tell to user what specific of photography he represent and specialize for (Wedding, Any type of Events and Business sessions)
Navbar Logo, should bring thoughts about camera lenses, again in aqua color to show relaxed style of photographer.

Next section-About, is a section about a spectrum of services what studio can make. From Family little events to promotional videos.
This section is divided by little cards to epmhasis and to highlight the options.

Bio section is about the main character -Seb Martinez as an owner of a studio and photographer.
Backgroud photo present himself but standing backwards for a purpose. He is looking on the horizon or on a place that would like to shoot.
In white frame there is a short biography text explaining who he is. Everything is delicate and smooth to not change easy going but proffesional character.

Gallery is divided on 4 columns and making nice and neaty overview of he is latest work.

Testimonials section has a little carousel effect. Again on dark background to make impression of profesionalism.

Contact section is on white background to distinct it from previous section. 
Again aqua buttons should make this feel of chilled environment.


## Technologies

### Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future this website would contain more popusps, and suppages.
- I would design better gallery based on javascript.

   2. try to press on "logo button" and verify if page is going back to home as a main page.

2. Navbar
   1.Go to "navbar section"
   2. Try to click on every section that contain Navabar and verify if navbar elements will take you to relevant sections.
   3. On small devices check if navbar changed to hamburger icon. 
   4. Try to press on Hamburger icon and check if dropdown works

3. Carousel 1 -with hero photos
   1. Carousel is programmed on 7 sec and instead of slide it disolve.
   2. Carosuel doesnt have indicators wich was designed that way.
   3. Wait 7 secs and check if carosuel photo changed on the next one in the queue

4. Carousel 2 -Testimonials
