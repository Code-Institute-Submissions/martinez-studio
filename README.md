# Martinez Studio

This website is made for a  professional photographer who is having his own Photography studio.
5 sections show the spectrum of his proffesion, little gallery, testimonials and social media and contact form.
This web page showing what kind of spectrum of photography he is making and what jobs he made previously.
This website shoud bring interest of customers wanting to hire him or just have a quick sneak peak who he is, and what kind of job studio can make

## UX 

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design.
The navyblue, aqua and white color scheme was chosen to create a modern and sleek feel. 
At the same time Photography made by studio Martinez are very close to nature, in surfer and chilled down style.
But at the same time navy blue and off white should show that he is making always premium service
This is why I chose this kind of color scheme.
 
Website is nice and neaty to navigate. First thing that potential user will see will be a carousel banner with three main photos.
This photos should tell to user what specific of photography he represent and specialize for (Wedding, Any type of Events and Business sessions)
Navbar Logo, should bring thoughts about camera lenses, again in aqua color to show relaxed style of photographer.

Next section-About, is a section about a spectrum of services what studio can make. From Family little events to promotional videos.
This section is divided by little cards to epmhasis and to highlight the options.

Bio section is about the main character -Seb Martinez as an owner of a studio and photographer.
Backgroud photo present himself but standing backwards for a purpose. He is looking on the horizon or on a place that would like to shoot.
In white frame there is a short biography text explaining who he is. Everything is delicate and smooth to not change easy going but proffesional character.

Gallery is divided on 4 columns and making nice and neaty overview of he is latest work.

Testimonials section has a little carousel effect. Again on dark background to make impression of profesionalism.

Contact section is on white background to distinct it from previous section. 
Again aqua buttons should make this feel of chilled environment.
 A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access.




Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Technologies

1. [HTML]
2. [CSS]
3. [Bootstrap 4] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction)
4. [Javascript] (https://www.javascripting.com/)
5. [Fontawesome]
6. [Jquery]

 
### Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future this website would contain more popusps, and suppages.
- I would design better gallery based on javascript.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
